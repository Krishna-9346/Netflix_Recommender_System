This project is an end-to-end Netflix-style movie recommendation system built in 3 stages:

## 📘 Project Breakdown

### 🔹 Level 1: Content-Based Filtering
- Uses movie metadata like genre and title
- Calculates cosine similarity
- Recommends similar movies based on input movie name

### 🔹 Level 2: Modular Code
- Refactored the content-based recommender into reusable Python functions
- Allows better structure, readability, and testing

### 🔹 Final Project: End-to-End System
- Accepts user input (movie + genre optional)
- Generates unseen movie recommendations
- Includes rating distribution plots
- Shows similar users' favorite genres and movies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
- Open any notebook
- Run all cells in Jupyter or Google Colab
